# Leandro: ableton-style audio synthesis software

Leandro is a piece of software that explores different methods of audio synthesis and different audio filters, written entirely in C++, using [portaudio](http://portaudio.com/) and [Qt](http://qt.io/).

It synthesizes notes from MIDI files using its own instruments and audio filters. After importing a .MIDI file, the user can choose from the different synthesizing methods and combine any number of filters and the melody will be generated accordingly.

Everyone loves images, so here's a screenshot of Leandro's main screen in action:

Leandro also supports multi-channel MIDI files, and allows for each channel to have its own synthesis method and assortment of audio filters:

After experimenting with different "instruments" and filters, you might like what you hear: the session's recording can be started and stopped at any point, and .wav files can be saved with the contents of those recordings.
